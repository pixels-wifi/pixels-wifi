Far from having reached the \"hero\" stage, I believe I can supply you with enough tools to avoid making the same mistakes I've made or had to deal with by sharing concrete advice on what you should have in mind when reading about the subject, bootstrapping your first prototypes or building, tuning and extending systems that use this kind of stuff.\n\n[speaker: Gabriel Candal, https://pixels.camp/gcandal]\n[language: English]"}, {"STATUS": "CONFIRMED", "DTSTAMP": "2017-10-01 14:28:01+00:00", "UID": "B7220FFF-4B81-415D-8648-FB5F38B894E8", "CREATED": "2017-08-22 12:23:01+00:00", "URL": "https://github.com/PixelsCamp/talks/blob/master/2017/how-can-javascript-improve-your-css-mixins_sandrina_pereira.md", "X-APPLE-TRAVEL-ADVISORY-BEHAVIOR": "AUTOMATIC", "SEQUENCE": "0", "TRANSP": "OPAQUE", "avatars": {"sandrina-p": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14869087?v=3"}, "SUMMARY": "How can Javascript improve your CSS Mixins", "LAST-MODIFIED": "<icalendar.prop.vDDDTypes object at 0x7f7ded358b10>", "LOCATION": "NOS Stage", "DTEND": "2017-09-28 17:00:00+00:00", "DTSTART": "2017-09-28 16:00:00+00:00", "id": "ee4a1fe0ad21644a846edf636a6f2c8f61ccd072", "DESCRIPTION": "Open a new window of possibilities to CSS: Faster compilation time, advanced logic, better styles scalability with Unit Testing and more.\n\nHow can we use Javascript in order to improve CSS?

Some of these techniques will be live demonstrated for a typical frontend application test and micro-service with an API and messaging.\n\n[speaker: Filipe Freire, https://pixels.camp/filfreire]\n[language: English]"}, {"STATUS": "CONFIRMED", "DTSTAMP": "2017-10-01 14:28:01+00:00", "UID": "A432327E-C312-4BB6-BA3E-285DC9B98BA4", "CREATED": "2017-09-18 00:54:22+00:00", "URL": "https://github.com/PixelsCamp/talks/blob/master/2017/more_my_type-luis_rodrigues.md", "X-APPLE-TRAVEL-ADVISORY-BEHAVIOR": "AUTOMATIC", "SEQUENCE": "0", "TRANSP": "OPAQUE", "avatars": {"goblindegook": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/285497?v=3"}, "SUMMARY": "More My Type: Developing React Applications in TypeScript", "LAST-MODIFIED": "<icalendar.prop.vDDDTypes object at 0x7f7decb0e150>", "LOCATION": "Beta-i Stage", "DTEND": "2017-09-30 13:00:00+00:00", "DTSTART": "2017-09-30 12:00:00+00:00", "id": "2546a437447880723029c867debedd76a9d89f3b", "DESCRIPTION": "An overview of the benefits of using typed languages when working with React and React Native, with examples in TypeScript, including setup using Webpack and tsc, a comparison with standard PropTypes and Flow, common caveats, and strategies for converting your existing applications.\n\n[speaker: Luis Rodrigues, https://pixels.camp/goblindegook]\n[language: English]"}, {"STATUS": "CONFIRMED", "DTSTAMP": "2017-10-01 14:28:01+00:00", "UID": "3DE27F50-AE6B-47D4-BE81-D027AD0CAC67", "CREATED": "2017-09-10 20:23:56+00:00", "URL": "https://github.com/PixelsCamp/talks/blob/master/2017/machine_Learning_in_the_wild-jaime_ferreira.md", "X-APPLE-TRAVEL-ADVISORY-BEHAVIOR": "AUTOMATIC", "SEQUENCE": "0", "TRANSP": "OPAQUE", "avatars": {"jaimerferreira": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/20725079?v=4"}, "SUMMARY": "Machine Learning in the Wild - What they don't teach you in books", "LAST-MODIFIED": "<icalendar.prop.vDDDTypes object at 0x7f7decb0e290>", "LOCATION": "Bright Pixel Stage", "DTEND": "2017-09-30 13:00:00+00:00", "DTSTART": "2017-09-30 12:00:00+00:00", "id": "8f185dd117978cb557e253095fcd01b1df636136", "DESCRIPTION": "In this talk you will learn why Machine Learning and Data Science are much more than algorithms. Out there, in real world industrial applications, it is a complex and intertwined mix of technology, domain constraints, intuition and team-work. Using real stories from Feedzai's experience fighting fraud in payments, we will illustrate why applying machine learning to live systems goes beyond using a dataset to train a predictive model. Technological issues such as scale, class balancing, concept drift, and data cleaning are a challenge to any data scientist, but they are only part of the story. In this talk, we will also show how non-technological issues can be so hard, and why good practices can have a tremendous impact on results.\n\n[speaker: Jaime Ferreira, https://pixels.camp/jaimerferreira]\n[language: English]"}, {"STATUS": "CONFIRMED", "DTSTAMP": "2017-10-01 14:28:01+00:00", "UID": "F9572B0E-1859-46C3-AFDA-9D362475C59A", "CREATED": "2017-08-28 20:00:30+00:00", "URL": "https://github.com/PixelsCamp/talks/blob/master/2017/1001-reasons-to-use-python_gil-goncalves.md", "X-APPLE-TRAVEL-ADVISORY-BEHAVIOR": "AUTOMATIC", "SEQUENCE": "0", "TRANSP": "OPAQUE", "avatars": {"LuRsT": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/263583?v=3"}, "SUMMARY": "1001 Reasons to use Python", "LAST-MODIFIED": "<icalendar.prop.vDDDTypes object at 0x7f7decb0e8d0>", "LOCATION": "Workshops", "DTEND": "2017-09-30 13:00:00+00:00", "DTSTART": "2017-09-30 12:00:00+00:00", "id": "a82a66cc01eecfbb6d34ca53e50577df66c30f81", "DESCRIPTION": "In this talk I'll showcase awesome things about the Python programming language and hopefully convince you on why you should use it.\n\nI will go through the pros and cons of using Python, talk a bit about it's history, compare it against other languages and talk about it's wonderful community.\n\nThis talk is for every developer looking for a new language to learn, for ways to convince their boss to use Python, or even for hobbyists looking for easy ways of solving their problems.\n\nQuestions that will be answered in this talk:\n\n- Should I learn Python?\n- Should my company use Python for X project?\n- What can I use Python for?\n- Is Python old and boring?\n\n[speaker: Gol Gon\u00e7alves, https://pixels.camp/lurst]\n[language: English]"}, {"STATUS": "CONFIRMED", "DTSTAMP": "2017-10-01 14:28:01+00:00", "UID": "75F9425A-EDCE-407E-9C4B-E32B2CFBDAF2", "CREATED": "2017-09-03 01:21:36+00:00", "URL": "https://github.com/PixelsCamp/talks/blob/master/2017/futurology_joao-carreiro.md", "X-APPLE-TRAVEL-ADVISORY-BEHAVIOR": "AUTOMATIC", "SEQUENCE": "0", "TRANSP": "OPAQUE", "avatars": {"Jhacarreiro": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19389037?v=3"}, "SUMMARY": "Futurology", "LAST-MODIFIED": "<icalendar.prop.vDDDTypes object at 0x7f7decb0ecd0>", "LOCATION": "Segfault Stage", "DTEND": "2017-09-30 13:00:00+00:00", "DTSTART": "2017-09-30 12:00:00+00:00", "id": "cceda109a7565d2488d97cc8f79ac74420c4aa43", "DESCRIPTION": "This is a talk about Futurology.

But this wasn't going to be just any smart office. It had to be capable of doing everything. And also anything . And it had to be distributed . And handle big data . And work offline . And support DIY stuff . And buzzwords. Also, it had to be cool and hip and run on Elixir .\n\nThe adventure begins when I wanted to optimise the productivity of our office at Subvisual by managing environmental values: temperature, humidity, sound levels and lighting. My first goal was to constantly display those readings and warn us if any of them was sub-optimal. I somehow got sidetracked and ended up with a P2P network in a distributed architecture or smth.\n\nIn this talk, I'll go through the implementation of a distributed architecture for a smart office. We will figure out how to connect Raspberries, Beaglebones and what not. Then go through distributed systems stuff like figure out if we want a server or P2P protocols and how to use eventual consistency. We'll get to know how to modify the P2P network to add any custom DIY node, but we'll mostly end up by collectively shaming myself for tapping into my developer's heart and pulling out what's at its core: a bunch of not-so-brilliant, over-engineered ideas.\n\n[speaker: Fernando Mendes, https://pixels.camp/fribmendes]\n[language: English]"}, {"STATUS": "CONFIRMED", "DTSTAMP": "2017-10-01 14:28:01+00:00", "DESCRIPTION": "[duration: false]", "CREATED": "2017-07-12 19:06:10+00:00", "X-APPLE-TRAVEL-ADVISORY-BEHAVIOR": "AUTOMATIC", "SEQUENCE": "0", "TRANSP": "OPAQUE", "avatars": {}, "SUMMARY": "Lunch", "LAST-MODIFIED": "<icalendar.prop.vDDDTypes object at 0x7f7ded594190>", "LOCATION": "Kitchen", "DTEND": "2017-09-30 14:00:00+00:00", "DTSTART": "2017-09-30 13:00:00+00:00", "id": "585ecb76103a7071c4d02f6d277b6ba65f79be94", "UID": "1B1FBCEC-AFE6-435D-9C78-3B6E73D434DB"}, {"STATUS": "CONFIRMED", "DTSTAMP": "2017-10-01 14:28:01+00:00", "DESCRIPTION": "[duration: false]", "CREATED": "2017-07-12 19:06:27+00:00", "X-APPLE-TRAVEL-ADVISORY-BEHAVIOR": "AUTOMATIC", "SEQUENCE": "0", "TRANSP": "OPAQUE", "avatars": {}, "SUMMARY": "48 hour non-stop programming contest ends", "LAST-MODIFIED": "<icalendar.prop.vDDDTypes object at 0x7f7ded554b90>", "LOCATION": "Pavilh\u00e3o Carlos Lopes", "DTEND": "2017-09-30 14:00:00+00:00", "DTSTART": "2017-09-30 13:00:00+00:00", "id": "ff5c814c887abcebfd915853f8524f2638ead1b5", "UID": "01576812-B3B5-49E2-B9BE-C897BE215B90"}, {"STATUS": "CONFIRMED", "DTSTAMP": "2017-10-01 14:28:01+00:00", "DESCRIPTION": "", "CREATED": "2017-07-12 19:06:53+00:00", "X-APPLE-TRAVEL-ADVISORY-BEHAVIOR": "AUTOMATIC", "SEQUENCE": "0", "TRANSP": "OPAQUE", "avatars": {}, "SUMMARY": "Stage tests for final presentations", "LAST-MODIFIED": "<icalendar.prop.vDDDTypes object at 0x7f7ded360e90>", "LOCATION": "Bright Pixel Stage", "DTEND": "2017-09-30 15:00:00+00:00", "DTSTART": "2017-09-30 14:00:00+00:00", "id": "8665330a164fd66bb4e591e3d903930cffd1ab21", "UID": "56181A41-5E48-4C62-B2BD-10E2F3FABB91"}, {"STATUS": "CONFIRMED", "DTSTAMP": "2017-10-01 14:28:01+00:00", "DESCRIPTION": "", "CREATED": "2017-07-12 19:07:16+00:00", "X-APPLE-TRAVEL-ADVISORY-BEHAVIOR": "AUTOMATIC", "SEQUENCE": "0", "TRANSP": "OPAQUE", "avatars": {}, "SUMMARY": "Final Projects Presentations", "LAST-MODIFIED": "<icalendar.prop.vDDDTypes object at 0x7f7ded3b46d0>", "LOCATION": "Bright Pixel Stage", "DTEND": "2017-09-30 17:30:00+00:00", "DTSTART": "2017-09-30 15:00:00+00:00", "id": "981fd61574ada27ce6042b9b34abb1f1a231f95a", "UID": "C2EB5348-5C9E-4587-846F-911DC199E1FA"}, {"STATUS": "CONFIRMED", "DTSTAMP": "2017-10-01 14:28:01+00:00", "DESCRIPTION": "", "CREATED": "2017-07-12 19:07:41+00:00", "X-APPLE-TRAVEL-ADVISORY-BEHAVIOR": "AUTOMATIC", "SEQUENCE": "0", "TRANSP": "OPAQUE", "avatars": {}, "SUMMARY": "Final remarks", "LAST-MODIFIED": "<icalendar.prop.vDDDTypes object at 0x7f7decb0eb90>", "LOCATION": "Bright Pixel Stage", "DTEND": "2017-09-30 18:00:00+00:00", "DTSTART": "2017-09-30 17:30:00+00:00", "id": "27bc8cbf8ea574a7d51c548e0124d84e7a606964", "UID": "B5E70424-62FA-4566-B89E-BC99CC103521"}, {"STATUS": "CONFIRMED", "DTSTAMP": "2017-10-01 14:28:01+00:00", "DESCRIPTION": "[duration: false]", "CREATED": "2017-07-12 19:07:58+00:00", "X-APPLE-TRAVEL-ADVISORY-BEHAVIOR": "AUTOMATIC", "SEQUENCE": "0", "TRANSP": "OPAQUE", "avatars": {}, "SUMMARY": "Hackathon and Launchpad Winners & Prizes", "LAST-MODIFIED": "<icalendar.prop.vDDDTypes object at 0x7f7ded379450>", "LOCATION": "Bright Pixel Stage", "DTEND": "2017-09-30 19:00:00+00:00", "DTSTART": "2017-09-30 18:00:00+00:00", "id": "26cf2f3e61d1cac412a375ea974804ed8e860c5b", "UID": "0F83AD87-2CB3-467F-8E53-B0E46EB0D1F7"}], "X-WR-TIMEZONE": "Europe/Lisbon", "VERSION": "2.0", "X-WR-CALDESC": "Calendar for Pixels Camp 2017", "METHOD": "PUBLISH", "PRODID": "-//Google Inc//Google Calendar 70.9054//EN"}}
